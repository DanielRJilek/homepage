## Project Objective

This repository contains a small personal portfolio website for a full-stack web developer. The site demonstrates projects, an about page, and a simple home/portfolio layout built with Bootstrap and static HTML/CSS/JS. Two pages (index and portfolio) were made individually, and the about page was generated
using VSCode agent and then modified.

Alternatively, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a simple local HTTP server to serve the files:

- Using Python 3 (recommended):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

- Using Node (if you have `serve`):

```bash
npx serve .
```
