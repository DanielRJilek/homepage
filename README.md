## Instructions to Build / Run Locally

This is a static site. You can open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a simple local HTTP server to serve the files:

- Using Python 3 (recommended):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

- Using Node (if you have `serve`):

```bash
npx serve .
```

Replace placeholder text (author, class link, and content) with your personal details and screenshots as needed.
